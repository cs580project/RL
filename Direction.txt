Here is a very brief direction to run the demo.

1.Play using greedy mouse. observe the winning rate and mouse behavior.

2.Play using smart mouse without training.

3.Train for 5000 times and play game and observe the winning rate and mouse behavior.

4.Train for more 50000 time and play. observe the winning rate and mouse behavior.
	conclusion 1: the more training, the better agent you get.

5.Switch to next map and training 20000 times and play. observe the winning rate and mouse behavior.
	conclusion 2: different maps matters a lot!

6.Change punish to 100 and do it again. observe the winning rate and mouse behavior.
	conclusion 3: differnet punish and reward generate different behavior.
